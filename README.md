# WaifuWallpaper
*Features*
1) This is an Anime(Waifu) Wallpaper Application which fetches wallpaper from "Waifu.pics" Public API & the user can also set those pics as the Wallpaper.
2) The Wallpaper Categories consists of SFW & NSFW, since the NSFW category contains inappropriate images this category is by default hidden from the user but if the user wants then he/she can enable the category by clicking several(7) times at "Version: 1.0" in Navigation Menu Header.
3) By default the Glide Dependency creates cache of images so the application size can increase over time while using.
